# Data Collection

Data collection can be useful for model work but can affect performance:

```ini
collect_data_while_playing = false
collect_only_when_targets_present = true
collect_save_every_n_frames = 15
collect_jpeg_quality = 95
auto_label_data = true
```

If capture diagnostics show `need_cpu_copy=true`, data collection may be one reason.
